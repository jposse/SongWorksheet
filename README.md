SONG WORKSHEET
==============

This song worksheet provides a nice template for song creation. 

Its based on Pat Pattison's (Berklee School of Music) version from his Coursera class on Songwriting. 

This PDF is a PDF-Form, meaning you can fill in the blanks on your computer and save for later. Its probably best when you save to do a "Save As" so each PDF you make will have a unique name (ie. Song1.pdf, Song2.pdf, etc).
